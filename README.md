# PL/SQL I<sup>3</sup>DE

we introduce <strong>I<sup>3</sup>DE (Inconsistency Inspecting IDE)</strong> â€” an IDE plugin to inspect inconsistencies
in PL/SQL code. We first observed the potential issues, e.g., misuses or bugs, that are introduced by the inconsistent
understanding of PL/SQL semantics by PL/SQL programmers and DBMS developers, and propose a metamorphic testing-based
approach for inspecting such inconsistencies in PL/SQL code. We design and implement our approach in I<sup>3</sup>DE, a
widely usable plugin for the IntelliJ Platform. We conducted a comparative user study involving 16 participants, and the
findings indicate that I<sup>3</sup>DE is consistently effective and efficient in helping programmers identify and avoid
inconsistencies across different programming difficulties.
